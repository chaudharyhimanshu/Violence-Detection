# Violence-Detection-in video
Real time violence in a video is a big problem, as it needs lot of computation power to process a video. In this project I did the comparison between the popular name in this field i.e., Optical Flow, and with my new way. The results were almost similar. I applied CNN-LSTM to train on hockey fight and violence in movies data set. Model was giving ~98% accuracy on training data set and ~90% on the test data set in just 50 epochs.
